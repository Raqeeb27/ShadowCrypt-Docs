## 📌 Project Summary

**ShadowCrypt** is a proactive ransomware defense tool built using Python that safeguards critical user files by:

- Hiding them in obscure, non-indexed Windows system directories.
- Encrypting file path mappings using AES-256 encryption.
- Providing access via secure, hash-embedded `.lnk` shortcuts.
- Supporting recovery mechanisms to restore hidden files safely.

This approach significantly reduces file visibility and exposure, rendering them inaccessible to ransomware—even after infection.
